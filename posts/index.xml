      <description>Choosing the Editor As I mentioned in one of my previous notes, an integrated development environment is something very natural for me. I feel more comfortable using &amp;#34;the whole package&amp;#34; rather than thinking about compiling, linking, debugging, profiling, UI building, etc. as about separate activities requiring separate tools. And yet, the &amp;#34;IDE approach&amp;#34; isn’t universal. I can’t have a full-fledged IDE for every language I use, and I don’t really need all the tools related to this or that technology.</description>

      <description>One of the Faces of Complexity Today I am planning to write on a topic that is addressed literally in every book on software engineering. Yet I believe that too many projects (including my own) need more attention to some of the most basic ways of fighting complexity. Complexity is, yeah, a complex phenomenon, discussed in numerous sources, including a highly influential Brooks’s No Silver Bullet essay. Recently I wrote about Black, which insists on code made up of short lines.</description>

      <title>Representing the World with Objects: a Telling Exercise</title>

      <description>The Adventure Begins I am not happy with this title, but the whole topic popped up a bit suddenly, and I decided to jot down some thoughts, while they are still fresh. It is going to be a little story about a very innocuous-looking tiny exercise that turned out to be more difficult than I anticipated, and thus made me thinking about the hardships of translating our common language into programming language concepts, say, using OOP.</description>

      <description>On Code and Formatting Styles One of my long-term goals is to setup a powerful development environment that would make the most of today’s technology. As someone who grew up using QuickBasic and C++Builder, I could never understand deliberate efforts to rely on simple text editors and command-line compilers. To me, it is like claiming that the past 20 or 30 years of toolmaking gave us nothing worthy of attention.</description>

      <description>The Problem Python is a very reasonable &amp;#34;default&amp;#34; language of choice for a variety of tasks. At least on desktop platforms, it makes sense to start with Python and see how it goes. Unfortunately, along its way to popularity it lost much of the simplicity that made it fun in the first place. An especially egregious aspect of Python is its poor backward compatibility. In practice it means that your codebase will only reliably work with a specific version of Python interpreter.</description>
