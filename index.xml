      <description>I prefer writing about tech stuff rather than comment ongoing news, but thinking about tech takes time and spare brain power, and I am short on both these months. On the other hand, my blog break is becoming uncomfortably long, and I thought I‚Äôd jump at the chance to pen this quick piece just for fun, or maybe as a way to evaluate my talents at predicting the future. Let‚Äôs see whether my judgement holds up in a few years time.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs interesting to watch both the development of modern AI instruments like ChatGPT or Midjourney and human reaction to this process. Most commenters tend to discuss wide implications for our economy, society, job market, etc. I think many of these talks are highly speculative, but it is completely normal to try forecasting the future, even when the grounds for such predictions are shaky.
 It‚Äôs fun to read such opinion pieces and imagine ourselves being somehow involved in certain tectonic processes (whether they are going to happen any time soon or not).</description>

      <description>Today‚Äôs note is inspired by my short experience with a cooperative variant of the board game Wingspan. Wingspan is designed as a competitive game, where each player tries to score as many points as possible by collecting certain combinations of bird cards. In order to build a combination, the player needs to spend various resources that can be obtained on each turn. By adding new birds to the current combination, the player also becomes more efficient in obtaining resources, so resources will buy you more birds, and birds will buy you even more resources.</description>

      <description>Intro One of the projects I hope to start soon is a game-like environment for teaching and learning concurrent programming. It has a very vague relation to an earlier system CPV, which I created for my graduation thesis around 2002. While collecting notes for the upcoming project, I thought it‚Äôs a good chance to review CPV to recall how it actually works, make sure it can be run on a modern computer, and possibly recycle some code.</description>

      <description>Today‚Äôs little essay has no goal other than to be mildly amusing and somewhat informative. We‚Äôll talk about Winograd schemas and other challenges related to the evaluation of computer‚Äôs ability to understand natural language texts.
 Let me state first that I belong to a somewhat &amp;#34;lower excitement&amp;#34; camp of AI enthusiasts. I tend to believe there is no other-worldly magic in human intelligence, and eventually we‚Äôll be able to build something resembling our brains and even surpassing them.</description>

      <description>Intro This is one of my reflective notes that merely help me to organize my thoughts rather than offer polished solutions suitable for a broad range of scenarios. Still, I hope I am about to discuss an important topic, and my take on it might have some value.
 There is a huge topic of &amp;#34;productivity&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;project management&amp;#34; and so on. In turn, it can be divided into subtopics like &amp;#34;organizing knowledge&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;managing a team&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;working with assignments&amp;#34;.</description>

      <description>To Mark or Not to Mark In today‚Äôs short note I want to reflect a bit on my (former?) habit of marking member functions static if they do not access instance data. For me it was the same as marking them const (in case of C++) if they do not modify anything inside their objects. Now I believe these scenarios are different and should be approached differently.
 The difference between const and non-const functions is rooted in the fundamental idea of command-query separation.</description>

      <description>Recently I‚Äôve been watching a talk by Vint Cerf on the topic of AI vs human intelligence. One part of this talk reminded me of an anecdote from my own experience, which I am going to share today.
 The relevant video fragment starts at 20:54, where Dr. Cerf explains adversarial neural networks and how they trick image classifiers into mistaking kittens for firetrucks or making other unbelievably dumb recognitions. His basic point is simple: each entity in a network is represented with an N-dimensional vector, and the job of the algorithm is to make sure that similar vectors appear nearby, so we can reliably separate the clusters of different object types.</description>

      <description>A vague title of this piece is deliberate: there is no single clear message I am going to send, but I think I am ought to express some feelings and share my thoughts on the ongoing events. In most cases I am inclined to let the things settle down and discuss them later, as I am quite a slow thinker, and it takes time for any consistent picture to form in my head.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago we had a lab meeting, where a student was presenting his summary of a paper he had read earlier. While in general his talk was OK, it was obvious he had difficulties extracting the essence of the paper. His talk was based on a fairly accurate section-by-section summary of the original text, so it was hard for us to figure out which of these parts really captured the authors&amp;#39; primary contribution.</description>

      <description>Intro Let‚Äôs have a less serious post this time for a change. Today I will explain how to create your own Minesweeper board game from simple materials, mostly cardboard.
 Surprisingly, an obvious idea of creating a sort of &amp;#34;real-life&amp;#34; version of Minesweeper has left little trace on the net. I can mention a couple of projects like Post-it Minesweeper and Minesweeper with tactile interface. The first approach is cute, but it‚Äôs really just a one-time fun; the second one is a bit too large-scale and serious, and it relies on electronics.</description>

      <description>A Quick Intro I needed to cite Dijkstra‚Äôs famous 1968 letter the other day, and finally had an easy chance to read it through. It would have been shame not to do it, given its modest size.
 There are many &amp;#34;folk beliefs&amp;#34; in our trade, as Bossavit‚Äôs book shows, that turn out to have quite a weak foundation. Currently, the &amp;#34;go to debate&amp;#34; is not on the table at all, as most modern languages have abandoned this operation (and it is used very sparingly anyway even when it is available).</description>

      <description>The Python Experience It took me a while to sit down and write this post, because I was actively experimenting with the VS Code setup for Python. I used it before, naturally, but having to write about something forces me to do my homework and make sure there are no obvious flaws in the suggestions I propose. Thus, I had to double-check all the tools and extensions I use for Python, and confirm that my setup is current.</description>

      <description>Choosing the Editor As I mentioned in one of my previous notes, an integrated development environment is something very natural for me. I feel more comfortable using &amp;#34;the whole package&amp;#34; rather than thinking about compiling, linking, debugging, profiling, UI building, etc. as about separate activities requiring separate tools. And yet, the &amp;#34;IDE approach&amp;#34; isn‚Äôt universal. I can‚Äôt have a full-fledged IDE for every language I use, and I don‚Äôt really need all the tools related to this or that technology.</description>

      <description>One of the Faces of Complexity Today I am planning to write on a topic that is addressed literally in every book on software engineering. Yet I believe that too many projects (including my own) need more attention to some of the most basic ways of fighting complexity. Complexity is, yeah, a complex phenomenon, discussed in numerous sources, including a highly influential Brooks‚Äôs No Silver Bullet essay. Recently I wrote about Black, which insists on code made up of short lines.</description>

      <description>The Adventure Begins I am not happy with this title, but the whole topic popped up a bit suddenly, and I decided to jot down some thoughts, while they are still fresh. It is going to be a little story about a very innocuous-looking tiny exercise that turned out to be more difficult than I anticipated, and thus made me thinking about the hardships of translating our common language into programming language concepts, say, using OOP.</description>

      <description>On Code and Formatting Styles One of my long-term goals is to setup a powerful development environment that would make the most of today‚Äôs technology. As someone who grew up using QuickBasic and C++Builder, I could never understand deliberate efforts to rely on simple text editors and command-line compilers. To me, it is like claiming that the past 20 or 30 years of toolmaking gave us nothing worthy of attention.</description>

      <description>The Problem Python is a very reasonable &amp;#34;default&amp;#34; language of choice for a variety of tasks. At least on desktop platforms, it makes sense to start with Python and see how it goes. Unfortunately, along its way to popularity it lost much of the simplicity that made it fun in the first place. An especially egregious aspect of Python is its poor backward compatibility. In practice it means that your codebase will only reliably work with a specific version of Python interpreter.</description>

      <description>This is the third incarnation of my home page. Its primary purpose had always been to keep some basic &amp;#34;about me&amp;#34; info, so I could easily send a link to a colleague or a prospective employer. Now I want to make my blog its primary focus.
 I‚Äôve never tried blogging on a regular basis, being more comfortable writing longer pieces like papers or books. However, occasionally I feel I know something that might be useful for others, so it makes sense to write about it.</description>

      <description>My computer story began with ZX Spectrum-compatible machines, and I still remember them fondly. Original ZX Spectrum was a British home computer created in 1982, and its numerous clones and variations were immensely popular in Russia of early 90s. At that time it was an incomparably cheaper alternative to PC, still providing a lot of fun for game and programming activities. Spectrum keeps its fandom even today, with dozens of titles released yearly.</description>
