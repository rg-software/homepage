      <description>The Problem Python is a very reasonable &#34;default&#34; language of choice for a variety of tasks. At least on desktop platforms, it makes sense to start with Python and see how it goes. Unfortunately, along its way to popularity it lost much of the simplicity that made it fun in the first place. An especially egregious aspect of Python is its poor backward compatibility. In practice it means that your codebase will only reliably work with a specific version of Python interpreter.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I had a chance to write something of a book length. I have ideas for future writings, but no firm plans as of today. Maybe I should try some other formats instead? We&amp;#8217;ll see.

      <description>This is the third incarnation of my home page. Its primary purpose had always been to keep some basic &#34;about me&#34; info, so I could easily send a link to a colleague or a prospective employer. Now I want to make my blog its primary focus.
 I&amp;#8217;ve never tried blogging on a regular basis, being more comfortable writing longer pieces like papers or books. However, occasionally I feel I know something that might be useful for others, so it makes sense to write about it.</description>

      <description>My computer story began with ZX Spectrum-compatible machines, and I still remember them fondly. Original ZX Spectrum was a British home computer created in 1982, and its numerous clones and variations were immensely popular in Russia of early 90s. At that time it was an incomparably cheaper alternative to PC, still providing a lot of fun for game and programming activities. Spectrum keeps its fandom even today, with dozens of titles released yearly.</description>
